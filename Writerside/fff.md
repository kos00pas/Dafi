# Federated Learning in Fuzzing: Overview and Embedded Systems Applications

## Overview: Applying Federated Learning to Fuzzing

**Fuzzing** is a software testing technique that feeds programs with a large number of semi-random or mutated inputs to trigger bugs or security vulnerabilities. 
Modern fuzzers (e.g., AFL) use feedback like code coverage to guide input generation and have found many bugs. 
A key insight from recent research is that **collaboration among multiple fuzzers can significantly improve bug-finding performance**.
For example, by *sharing progress information between different fuzzing instances*, an ensemble of fuzzers can outperform each fuzzer running in isolation.
Frameworks like **CollabFuzz** (EuroSec 2021) demonstrate that coordinating multiple fuzzers under a central scheduler (sharing interesting test cases and analysis results) yields better coverage and bug discovery.

**Federated learning (FL)** is a decentralized machine learning approach where multiple clients (devices or nodes) train a shared model collaboratively without directly exchanging their local data. 
Instead, each client computes updates to the model (e.g. gradient or parameter updates) and a central server periodically aggregates these to form a global model. This preserves data privacy and security, since raw test data or program states need not leave the local devices.

Applying FL to fuzzing – sometimes termed *federated fuzzing* – means using a **shared machine learning model to guide fuzzing across distributed nodes**, without those nodes sharing raw input corpora or sensitive information about their systems.

### Motivations

- Combine coverage benefits of collaborative fuzzing with **privacy and decentralization**.
- Enable **cross-device or cross-organization fuzzing campaigns**.
- Protect proprietary firmware, seed inputs, and internal protocol data.

### Key Challenges

- **Non-IID Data**: Different nodes have different environments and input distributions.
- **Communication Overhead**: Exchanging model updates must be efficient.
- **Model-Fuzzing Alignment**: Designing useful shared models (e.g., input predictors).
- **Security Risks**: FL is vulnerable to poisoning and leakage.

### Benefits

- **Collective Intelligence**: Discover wider classes of bugs across devices.
- **Privacy-Preserving Collaboration**: No raw data sharing needed.
- **Improved Detection**: Models trained on fuzzing outcomes enhance accuracy.
- **Scalability**: Parallel fuzzing at scale across IoT/embedded devices.

## Academic Research on Federated Learning in Fuzzing

### 1. Federated Learning-based Routing Vulnerability Analysis (Kowsalyadevi & Balaji, 2024)

- **Venue**: Int. Journal of Intelligent Engineering and Systems.
- **Summary**: Applies federated learning to fuzz the RPL routing protocol in healthcare IoT systems.
- **Approach**: Each device fuzzes locally and trains an RNN; a CNN-LSTM model is trained globally via FL.
- **Result**: 5–12% improvement in detection accuracy over isolated models.
- **Use case**: Embedded systems security in medical IoT.

### 2. VDBFL: Vulnerability Detection via Federated Learning (Zhang et al., 2024)

- **Summary**: Combines fuzzing, static analysis, and FL to detect software vulnerabilities.
- **Approach**: Clients extract features from fuzzing and static analysis, train locally, and aggregate models.
- **Outcome**: Higher detection accuracy without sharing code or crashes.
- **Use case**: Cross-organization software testing with privacy.

### 3. VIFL: Federated Learning for IoT Security (Issa et al., 2024)

- **Venue**: *Computing* (Springer).
- **Summary**: FL-based anomaly detection in IoT networks (not direct fuzzing but related).
- **Techniques**: Staleness handling, differential privacy, and variance reduction.
- **Outcome**: ~90% detection accuracy with privacy guarantees.
- **Relevance**: Demonstrates FL feasibility for distributed embedded security.

## Federated Fuzzing in Embedded Systems: Outlook

- Embedded/IoT devices often cannot share raw binaries or inputs.
- FL allows **knowledge sharing without data exposure**.
- Early studies (like on RPL protocol fuzzing) show strong potential.
- Future directions:
    - Lightweight FL aggregation for constrained devices.
    - Neural models that guide fuzzing effectively.
    - Security-hardened FL against model poisoning.
