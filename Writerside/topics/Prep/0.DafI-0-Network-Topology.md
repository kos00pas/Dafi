# Dynamic Analysis for OpenThread Network Interoperability Testing
## Dynamic Analysis for Interoperability (DAfI)
Dynamic analysis evaluates a system's real-time behavior and performance during execution.
This approach, also known as Dynamic Program Analysis or Dynamic Application Security Testing (DAST), is essential for identifying network stability, role transition behaviors, and protocol efficiency in a simulated OpenThread environment using Renode with nRF52840.
By focusing on a single hardware platform (Nordic nRF52840), this study ensures consistent and fair evaluations of OpenThread’s network behavior, IPv6 routing efficiency, RPL stability, and dynamic role transitions, without introducing emulator-based biases.
The testing framework enables controlled topology scaling and role transitions, allowing for comprehensive analysis while maintaining interoperability within a standardized environment.

---

## Focus
Inspect how the OpenThread mesh network dynamically adapts and maintains stable operations under:
  * Node role transitions (e.g., Router ↔ End Device, Leader elections).
  * Topology changes (scaling up/down, adding/removing nodes) within a Renode-based nRF52840 environment.

### Simultaneously, we evaluate OpenThread's protocol-level performance:
- IPv6 Handling: Validate OpenThread’s ability to correctly assign, route, and forward IPv6 packets while optimizing overhead through 6LoWPAN header compression.
- RPL Routing Stability: Ensure routing decisions remain adaptive and consistent under network dynamics.
- 6LoWPAN Efficiency: Evaluate how OpenThread compresses and efficiently transmits IPv6 packets over constrained networks.
- Seamless Communication: Measure OpenThread’s ability to maintain stable network connectivity when nodes join, leave, or change roles dynamically.

| Type | Architecture        | Role                 |
|------|---------------------|----------------------|
| FTD  | Nordic (nRF52840)   | Border Router  & RCP |
|      |                     |                      |
| FTD  | Nordic (nRF52840)   | FED                  |
|      |                     | REED                 |
|      |                     | Router               |

* promotions
- FED → REED: ( cannot promote  unless it was initially a REED).  
- REED → Router: (A REED can promote to Router if the network requires a new Router).
* demotions 
*  REED → FED: (A REED can be demoted to FED if it no longer qualifies to be promoted to Router
*  Router → FED: (A Router can be demoted to FED if it loses routing capabilities or becomes unnecessary).


In OpenThread, the Leader is NOT pre-assigned manually. Instead, it is dynamically elected based on network conditions.

Requirements:
  * The nRF52840 supports OpenThread fully and runs Zephyr OS in Docker.
  * The nRF52840 can be emulated in Renode for OpenThread testing.
  * Keep only FTDs (Full Thread Devices) – No need for MTDs.
  * Use REEDs instead of fixed Routers – This allows testing dynamic role transitions.
  * nRF52840 acts as a Border Router in RCP mode – This enables network connectivity outside Thread.

## Stages 

###  Step 1: Baseline Measurements 
Establish a stable network before introducing topology changes by evaluating OpenThread’s fundamental network & hardware performance.

  - IPv6 communication is functional and stable.
3. Profile hardware performance on nRF52840 under normal network conditions.
4. Record baseline performance across all network & hardware metrics to establish a reference for later topology changes and scaling.
