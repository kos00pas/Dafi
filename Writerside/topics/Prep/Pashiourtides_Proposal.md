## Pashiourtides Costas  1013431

## **1. Introduction and Project Explanation**
The increasing adoption of the **Thread networking protocol** in IoT applications highlights the importance of **interoperability testing** to ensure seamless communication between heterogeneous devices. This project aims to **evaluate OpenThread’s network interoperability** using **Zephyr OS in Docker with QEMU**, enabling a **multi-node wireless sensor network (WSN) simulation**.

By leveraging **Dockerized Zephyr OpenThread nodes**, we will analyze network behavior across **different architectures (ARM, x86)**, study **IPv6 and RPL routing**, and assess **latency and reliability differences between platforms**. The objective is to ensure OpenThread **operates efficiently across diverse IoT environments**.

### **Expected Outcomes**
- A **Docker-based Zephyr OpenThread network** simulating real-world IoT deployments.
- Identification of **network performance and reliability differences across multiple architectures**.
- Analysis of **OpenThread’s IPv6, 6LoWPAN, and RPL protocol interactions**.
- **Recommendations for optimizing OpenThread’s interoperability** in multi-platform IoT applications.

## **2. Description of Work to Be Carried Out**
The project will be structured into three main phases:

### **Phase 1: Setting Up Zephyr OpenThread in Docker**
- Deploy **Zephyr-based OpenThread nodes** in a **Dockerized QEMU environment**.
- Configure **multi-node communication** (Router, End Device, Border Router) within the simulated network.
- Establish **IPv6 routing with 6LoWPAN compression** over OpenThread.

### **Phase 2: Network Interoperability Testing**
- **Multi-Node Communication:**  
  - Ensure seamless **IPv6 data exchange between OpenThread devices**.  
  - Validate **RPL (Routing Protocol for Low-power networks)** in a dynamic multi-node environment.  
- **Cross-Platform Performance Evaluation:**  
  - Test OpenThread nodes on **ARM (MPS2-AN521, STM32F7) and x86 (UP Squared Board)**.  
  - Measure **latency, packet loss, and routing efficiency across different architectures**.

### **Phase 3: Analyzing and Reporting Interoperability Results**
- Capture and analyze network traffic using:
  - **`tcpdump` for packet capture** at the network level.  
  - **Zephyr logging (`net_pkt`, shell, `net_capture`)** for in-depth OpenThread debugging inside Zephyr OS.
- Identify **potential bottlenecks in OpenThread routing and IPv6 communication**.
- Generate a **report on OpenThread’s multi-node performance, scalability, and reliability**.

## **3. Resources Needed**
### **Software:**
- **Zephyr OS (with OpenThread support)**
- **Docker** (for containerized testing)
- **QEMU** (for multi-architecture emulation)
- **tcpdump & Zephyr Logging (`net_pkt`, shell, `net_capture`)** (for network analysis)

### **Hardware (Emulated & Physical Devices):**
- No dedicated hardware required for initial testing (**fully virtualized using Docker & QEMU**).
- **STM32F7 Series** → *(End Device, Router, Commissioner)*
- **MPS2-AN521** → *(Router, Leader, End Device)*
- **UP Squared Board** → *(Ideal for Border Router)*

### **Custom Dataset**
This project will generate and use a **custom dataset**, which will include:
- **Packet captures from `tcpdump`**, focusing on **IPv6, 6LoWPAN, and OpenThread control messages**.
- **Zephyr OpenThread logs** from **`net_pkt`, shell debugging, and `net_capture`**.
- **Interoperability test results** across **different architectures (ARM, x86)**, recording **latency, throughput, and error rates**.
- **Routing behavior data** (RPL topology changes, leader elections, and network healing after failures).
- **Performance benchmarks** comparing **OpenThread communication reliability on different hardware architectures**.

- **CNI:** Evaluating **OpenThread’s reliability and security in multi-node architectures** is vital for **critical infrastructure** (e.g., **power grids, emergency networks, and secure communications**).  
- **Standardization Support:** Findings from this research can **contribute to OpenThread’s adoption** in **mission-critical IoT deployments**.

### **Contribution to Course Objectives**
- Develops hands-on experience with **Zephyr OS in Docker & QEMU** for IoT simulation.
- Demonstrates **real-world interoperability challenges in OpenThread networks**.
- Supports **standardization efforts in IoT connectivity and protocol testing**.
