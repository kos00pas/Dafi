### Baseline Metrics (Step 1)

| #  | Inter. Test | Measurement                                  | Description                                                                    | 
|----|------------|----------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 1  | (N, T)     | Leader Election Time                         | Measure initial Leader setup time.                                             |
| 2  | (N, T)     | RPL Route Stability & Update Efficiency      | Ensure all nodes share synchronized route tables and adapt to topology changes. |
| 3  | (N, T)     | Packet Delivery Ratio (PDR) During Changes   | Confirm stable packet transmission in steady-state conditions.                 |
| 4  | (N, T)     | Topology Convergence Time                    | Track how quickly routing tables stabilize after initial deployment.           |
| 5  | (N, T)     | Multicast Propagation Delay                  | Evaluate how fast RPL control messages (DIO/DAO) propagate across the network. |
| 6  | (N, H)     | IPv6 Packet Forwarding Efficiency            | Validate that packets are correctly routed between nRF52840 nodes.             |
| 7  | (N, H)     | 6LoWPAN Compression Efficiency               | Measure IPv6 header compression ratio to ensure optimized network overhead.    |
| 8  | (H)        | CPU Utilization                              | Measure CPU load on nRF52840 under normal conditions.                          |
| 9  | (H)        | Memory Usage (RAM)                           | Evaluate memory footprint within nRF52840 constraints.                         |
| 10 | (H)        | Execution Time Per Task                      | Measure the time taken to process OpenThread tasks on nRF52840.                |
