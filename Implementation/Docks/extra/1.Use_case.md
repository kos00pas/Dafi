## Predictive Maintenance  : Remote Solar Panel Monitoring for Energy Efficiency & Equipment Health
This document defines the structured sensor data collected by Thread End Nodes in the Remote Solar Panel Monitoring System.

### Use Cases
* Monitor real-time solar panel efficiency based on power generation.
* Detect overheating risks and environmental effects on performance.
* Prevent inverter damage by monitoring power spikes and temperature.
* Enable AI-driven predictive maintenance for reduced downtime.

## Data Points

#### Solar Panel Efficiency Tracking
  * ` power_output` → Current power generated (Watts).
  * ` energy_generated` → Total cumulative energy produced (kWh).
  * ` voltage` → Voltage output of the panel (Volts).
  * ` current` → Current flow (Amps).
####  Environmental Impact & Overheating Risks
  * ` temperature` → Panel surface temperature (°C).
  * ` ambient_temperature` → External weather temperature (°C).
  * ` humidity` → Relative humidity (%).
  * ` wind_speed` → Wind speed affecting panel cooling (m/s).
#### Dirt & Sunlight Conditions
  * ` dust_level` → Dust accumulation on the panel (arbitrary unit).
  * ` light_intensity` → Amount of sunlight reaching the panel (%).
  * `panel_tilt_angle` → Panel tilt position for optimal sunlight (°).
#### Inverter & Battery Monitoring
 * `inverter_temperature` → Heat level of the inverter (°C).
 * `battery_charge_level` → Battery charge status (%).
 * `battery_voltage` → Battery output voltage (Volts).
####  Predictive Maintenance & Alerts
  * `power_spike_detected` → Boolean flag for sudden power fluctuations.
  * `status` → Overall health of the panel:
  * `nominal` → Everything is working fine.
  * `warning` → Potential issue detected, maintenance suggested.
  * `failure` → Critical problem detected, immediate intervention required.
